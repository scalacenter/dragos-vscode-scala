# Language server + profiledb for Scala [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dragos/dragos-vscode-scala)

**This is a fork of vscode-scala to illustrate how to display profiling information
in an IDE-like editor using the profiledb in [scalac-profiling]**.

This is just a proof-of-concept that we hope motivates IDEs like Intellij to follow suit
and integrate with projects that use the profiledb and the scalac-profiling plugin.

For more information about the Language server integration developed by [Iulian Dragos],
head to the [vscode-scala] integration.
